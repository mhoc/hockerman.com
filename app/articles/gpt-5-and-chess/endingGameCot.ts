The user has surrendered, so there's no move to report. However, the rules say I must respond with FEN or identify an illegal move. Since there’s no move here, I'll follow the instructions and end the game with a final message that respects the formal requirements.

The user has resigned, so there isn't a move to make. The instruction says only to provide a FEN or a statement when a move is illegal. Since the user hasn’t made a move, I can't follow the usual format. Maybe I can acknowledge the resignation, but I’ll need to make sure it aligns with the rules.

The user has changed the conversation style, shifting from a position move to resignation, which complicates things. I want to acknowledge their resignation but have to follow the rule: a FEN or statement about an illegal move. A simple “Good game” may be too casual, but reusing the same FEN could feel repetitive.

The user didn’t make a move, but I need to stick to the instruction to either provide a FEN or statement about an illegal move. “Your move is illegal” fits, since no move was made, but it doesn’t sound ideal. A more neutral and acceptable response might be needed.
