      <Ap>
        With the recent release of GPT-5, I am curious how its ability to play chess has improved, if it is capable of
        at least playing a valid game of chess, and where its skill ranks against more specialized chess engines.
      </Ap>
      <Ap>
        My goal with this write-up is, first, to validate a baseline level of competence to ensure this investigation is
        worthwhile. After that, we may expand the testing by automating play between GPT-5 and a modern chess engine
        like Stockfish.
      </Ap>
      <Ah1 id="validating-baseline-competence">Validating Baseline Competence</Ah1>
      <Ap>
        Chess boards can be represented in text using{" "}
        <Aa href="https://www.chess.com/terms/fen-chess">Forsyth-Edwards Notation</Aa> (or FEN). For example, the FEN
        string for a starting chess board looks like:
      </Ap>
      <Acode>rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1</Acode>
      <Ap>
        To establish that this pursuit is even worthwhile, we can use ChatGPT to get a baseline level of {"GPT-5's "}
        competence in playing chess. These tests were completed on 2025-08-13 using a ChatGPT Plus subscription & the
        model set to ChatGPT 5 Thinking. The following un-optimized prompt was used:

        So far, the FEN strings provided are syntactically valid, the moves it makes are legal, and it correctly
        maintains the state of the board as we progress. On {"GPT-5's"} third move, it captured a pawn which Stockfish
        had exposed; interesting that it recommended that move, but what do I know about chess. Onward.

        {"Stockfish's"} fourth move added clarity to why it sacrificed the pawn in the third move; it baited their pawn
        into being captured by our knight. Always trust Stockfish.

        {"GPT-5's"} fifth move constituted an illegal play. It correctly moved the G7 pawn to G6, but it additionally

      <Ap>{"That's"} fair; I did tell it to only respond with FEN notation.</Ap>
      <Ap>
        The FEN notation it replied with correctly removed the hallucinated pawn on D7, putting the game back into a
        playable state. It thought for 1m21s to achieve this outcome, which was significantly longer than it took to
        think through previous moves (ranging from 16s-45s).
      </Ap>
      <Ap>
        This outcome indicates that a full and valid game may be possible with proper prompting. A harness around GPT-5
        which can detect invalid moves and course-correct the model may also be necessary.
      </Ap>
      <Ap>
        However, given that I was unable to achieve a valid one-shot game, this experiment cannot proceed to the second
        phase. Future experiments in this domain may be refocused on building this harness and getting the LLM into a
        state where it can actually play.

        For this game, I will be playing without Stockfish, and giving it purposefully different moves than the last
        experiment. My third move will be illegal, by moving {"GPT-5's"} knight from F6 to G6. This is illegal both from

        {"I'm"} unfamiliar with the syntax (`2...e5`) it is using to communicate the nature of its

        The initial prompting only gave GPT-5 permission to deviate from FEN notation should the

        Its response is an identical board state as before I sent the message, indicating to me that
        it resisted the false accusation. I would additionally define this as the most valid way it
        could communicate this to me, given its constraints to only speak in FEN notation unless the
        user makes an illegal move. {"GPT-5's"} chain of thought for this output is as follows:
      </Ap>
      <Ap>
        Some of {"GPT-5's"} reasoning in this chain of thought is questionable; for example, while
        there is a white knight on D4 which has control of E6, this does not immediately threaten
        the black king. GPT-5 states corrected reasoning in its final paragraph.

        Most of its thought surrounds conformance to my original rule that it only respond with a
        FEN string or an accusation of an illegal move by the player. It comes to the reasonable
        conclusion that, because the game is over, it may break this rule.

        Nothing in its output or chain of thought indicates that it understands that I surrendered
        on suspicious or incorrect grounds. However, because I communicated my explicit intent to
        surrender, its decision to accept that surrender is logical.
