Hm, so Black has just moved d7 to d5, and the en passant square in the FEN is shown as d6. That’s right! The en passant square represents where White’s pawn could capture Black's pawn if the next move is the right one. Looks good now that I’ve clarified it!

Okay, so after White's knight moved from f3 to d4, the en passant square becomes "-," which is correct. This means Black's move is next, and the halfmove clock is at 1. Black played e6 afterward. Checking the FEN, everything looks consistent now, especially with the updated pawn positions — it's all set!

Alright, Black moved a pawn from e7 to e5, which seems perfectly legal. The FEN still reflects the correct move number and halfmove clock. The updated positions show a pawn on d5 and now one on e5. So everything looks good here—no issues with the legality of the move!

Okay, so Black moved e7 to e5, which is indeed legal. The FEN shows that correctly, indicating a double pawn push. Wait—could it be that the move leaves Black's king in check? The knight on d4 is controlling e6, so yes, that could be the issue, making e7-e5 illegal if it leaves the king in check.

I see that Black's move from e7 to e5 is a legal double pawn push. But maybe the user called it "illegal" because it leaves Black's king in check. I checked, and the knight on d4 does indeed control e6, which would threaten the king if it moved. So, that would make the move illegal after all!

Black's e7 to e5 is indeed a legal move. The knight on d4 doesn't place the black king in check. Neither do any white pieces on the board. Since there’s no violation of the rules, this move is valid. I'll just output the same FEN and avoid extra text as per the instructions.
